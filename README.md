# dssb
dssb (Dmitry's Static Site Builder) is my personal static site builder, written in python. It generates the pages for my website, [ds0.xyz](https://ds0.xyz), which is then simply served with nginx.

dssb has minimal features that reflect my own needs. As such, it will likely only receive updates when I personally feel the need to implement a new feature for myself.

## Installation
A release binary for Linux systems will be available soon.
