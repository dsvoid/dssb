# Example Post
This is an example of a page using the blog post template, `templates/post.html`, generated from `content/example_post.md`. Pages using this template are indexed in an automatically-built archive page, where they will be sorted by their `publish_date`. The post is also indexed in a page for each of its tags. Finally, a link to the previous and next post in the archive is added, if applicable.
